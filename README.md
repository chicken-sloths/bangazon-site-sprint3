## Summary
A sales website for a mock Amazon + Etsy platform. Written by Nashville Software School Apprentice Developers during a week-long Agile sprint. 

Users can: 
1. Login and register as customers
1. Create and delete products to sell
1. Create and delete payment options
1. View available products and add them to their cart
1. Delete products from cart
1. Close out orders

## Context
We were presented with 22 User Stories and selected 11 of them. 
1. An accurate assessment of our team's velocity based on availability and outside commitments
1. Clean code, extensive edge-case testing, & in-depth code reviews

We identified the 11 User Stories that we could combine into a logical, well-rounded user interface. As a team, we decied to prioritize quality over quantity. We focused on thorough code reviews, extensive edge-case testing, and allowing time to refactor our code before the end of the sprint.
